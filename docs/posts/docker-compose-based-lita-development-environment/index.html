        <p>In the continuation of the Lita development that I&rsquo;ve been doing recently, I&rsquo;ve found myself needing a more sophisticated development environment for Lita. Running <code>bundle exec lita</code> locally just was not cutting it anymore. My Lita plugin was starting to pepper my hard-drive with various files and the number of services I was needing to manually install and manage on my local machine was increasing. Unfortunately, the Lita plugin that inspired this work is not currently open source, but I&rsquo;ve managed to replicate the setup with a Lita plugin that I have open-sourced: <a href="https://github.com/tduffield/lita-announce">lita-announce</a>.</p>

<p>So the foundation of this setup is the <a href="https://github.com/tduffield/lita-announce/blob/master/docker-compose.yml">docker-compose.yml</a>, which contains two services: Lita and Redis.</p>

<pre><code>version: '3'
services:
  lita:
    build: .
    links:
      - redis:redis
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
      - ./.docker_bundle:/app/.bundle
    environment:
      - SLACK_TOKEN
  redis:
    image: redis
</code></pre>

<p>Now, Lita already has a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/litaio/lita/">docker image</a> that you can use to run Lita, but their image is intended for &ldquo;production&rdquo; cases. I needed something focused on development, which is where my <a href="https://github.com/tduffield/lita-announce/blob/master/Dockerfile">customized Dockerfile</a> came in.</p>

<pre><code>FROM ruby:2.3
MAINTAINER Tom Duffield &lt;tom@chef.io&gt;

RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get install -y git &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get clean &amp;&amp; \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/*

RUN gem install bundler &amp;&amp; mkdir /app
COPY start /start
WORKDIR /app
CMD [&quot;/start&quot;]
</code></pre>

<p>This Dockerfile is very similar to the one for <code>litaio/lita</code>, but with a few differences. First, it is based off the latest Ruby 2.3 version rather than 2.3.0 (which has some known bugs). Second, it has a <a href="https://github.com/tduffield/lita-announce/blob/master/start">customized start script</a> that executes the lita process via <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard-process">guard-process</a>.</p>

<pre><code>bundle install --path /var/bundle --jobs $(nproc) --clean
exec bundle exec guard
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tduffield/lita-announce/blob/master/Guardfile">Guardfile</a> that I used watches the lita_config.rb file, as well as the entire <code>lib/</code> directory of my plugin, for file changes and restarts the Lita process if any changes are necessary.</p>

<pre><code>interactor :off
guard &quot;process&quot;, name: &quot;Lita&quot;, command: &quot;bundle exec lita&quot; do
  watch(&quot;lita_config.rb&quot;)
  watch(%r{^lib/*})
end
</code></pre>

<p>Because I&rsquo;m <a href="https://github.com/tduffield/lita-announce/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L9">syncing my plugin directory directly into the /app folder on my container</a>, any changes that I make locally are immediately available in the container. The end result is that the Lita service in my container will restart anytime I make a change to a file locally. This allows me to iterate very quickly when attempting to functionally test my plugin without having to manually restart my process.</p>

<p>If you want to see all of the changes that were necessary, you can view them all in <a href="https://github.com/tduffield/lita-announce/commit/52c5119f17be33858a75b2243052b6c52d480854">this commit</a>.</p>
